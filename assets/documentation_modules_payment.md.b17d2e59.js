There are 2 main objectives in module concept:</p><ul><li>Have a functionality having multiple possible implementation</li></ul><p>This is possible for functionality such as &#39;payment&#39; or &#39;shipping&#39; where a multitude of payment or shipping modules may be offered to a customer (example Stripe, Paypal...) or a decision made at runtime requiring to use a specific module (example pricing modules).</p><ul><li>Have the possibility to change a specific implementation without changing the interface.</li></ul><p>This concept allows changing from one implementation to another, for example email implementation to use javax.mail or AWS SES.</p><h2 id="payment-modules" tabindex="-1">Payment modules <a class="header-anchor" href="#payment-modules" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p><em>com.salesmanager.core.business.services.paymentsPaymentServiceImpl.processPayment()</em> does the logic of preparing and validating payment to be processed during checkout. It then invokes selected PaymentModule implementation corresponding to the payment option user selected to use.</p><h3 id="creation-of-a-new-paymentmodule" tabindex="-1">Creation of a new PaymentModule\\ <a class="header-anchor" href="#creation-of-a-new-paymentmodule" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>A payment gateway is a merchant service provided by payment service providers that authorizes credit card or direct\xA0payments\xA0processing for e-businesses, online retailers, bricks and clicks, or traditional brick and mortar. A payment gateway needs to be configured in Shopizer in order to process online payments.</p><p>There are many payment gateway solutions available for integrating with Shopizer. Our recommendation is to look for PCI compliant Hosted Tokenization (HT) solution.<br> HT is a solution for online e\u2010commerce merchants that do not wish to handle credit card numbers directly on their websites and uses token technology as a correspondence alias between the e-commerce site and the service provider instead of the credit card number. Shopizer does integrate with HT PCI solutions such as Stripe, Braintree and Paypal.</p><p>Most payment service provides those apis:</p><ul><li><p><strong>authorize</strong>: Transaction is only authorized and not charged to the card. This is generally used when selling hard goods like Amazon. The card is verified and the transaction is authorized for making sure there is enough credit available. When using the authorize method then the transaction has to be captured just before shipping the item.</p></li><li><p><strong>capture</strong>: This method is used when an authorization transaction has been made on the card before. Capture transaction will charge the amount on the credit card.</p></li><li><p><strong>authorize</strong> and capture: This method is used when authorization and capture happen during the same transaction. A common use case for this is for selling digital products having to charge the amount before sending download link to customer. This can be also used when selling hard goods, it&#39;s a dynamic configuration from Shopizer immediately available after changing charge function.</p></li><li><p><strong>refund</strong>: This methods refunds entirely or partially a previous transaction.<br> Implementing your own payment module</p></li></ul><p>When you need to create a new integration with another payment gateway than the one already available in Shopizer you need to perform the following steps:</p><p>Selection of your payment gateway</p><p>A payment gateway will require opening a service account and link that to your bank account. Usually they have a test and a production environment and will invite you to perform all possible tests with their test environment before deciding to use the production environment. They also have an api that you will have to connect with your payment module. That api will require authentication using one to multiple keys that you will have to be saved in Shopizer when this payment method is configured.</p><ul><li>Define a payment service as a module</li></ul><p>Once the selection of a payment gateway is done the next step is to define a payment module corresponding to this payment service. Payment methods are defined in shopizer/sm-core/src/main/resources/reference/integrationmodules.json in json format. A new payment service will require the following fields:</p><p>Example with javascript</p><p>var settings = {</p><p>&quot;async&quot;: true,</p><p>&quot;crossDomain&quot;: true,</p><p>&quot;url&quot;: &quot;<a href="http://localhost:8080/services/private/system/module" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://localhost:8080/services/private/system/module</a>&quot;,</p><p>&quot;method&quot;: &quot;POST&quot;,</p><p>&quot;headers&quot;: {</p><p>&quot;authorization&quot;: &quot;Basic YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQ=&quot;,</p><p>&quot;cache-control&quot;: &quot;no-cache&quot;</p><p>},</p><p>&quot;data&quot;: &quot;{&quot;module&quot;: &quot;PAYMENT&quot;,&quot;code&quot;: &quot;mytest&quot;,&quot;type&quot;: &quot;creditcard&quot;,&quot;version&quot;: &quot;104.0&quot;,&quot;regions&quot;: [&quot;*&quot;],&quot;image&quot;: &quot;icon-paypal.png&quot;,&quot;configuration&quot;: [{&quot;env&quot;: &quot;TEST&quot;,&quot;scheme&quot;: &quot;https&quot;,&quot;host&quot;: &quot;<a href="http://www.sandbox.mytest.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.sandbox.mytest.com</a>&quot;,&quot;port&quot;: &quot;80&quot;,&quot;uri&quot;: &quot;/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=&amp;token=&quot;,&quot;config1&quot;: &quot;beta-version&quot;}, {&quot;env&quot;: &quot;PROD&quot;,&quot;scheme&quot;: &quot;https&quot;,&quot;host&quot;: &quot;<a href="http://www.production.mytest.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.production.mytest.com</a>&quot;,&quot;port&quot;: &quot;80&quot;,&quot;uri&quot;: &quot;/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=&amp;token=&quot;,&quot;config1&quot;: &quot;RELEASE&quot;}]\\n}&quot;</p><p>}</p><p>$.ajax(settings).done(function (response) {</p><p>console.log(response);</p><p>});</p><p>Example using postman</p><p>Username and password are required to perform this operation. Any user in Shopizer with admin or api role can perform this. Default username in shopizer is admin and default password is password. Authentication for this service is Basic and requires base64 encoding.</p><ul><li>Implement code for this new module</li></ul><p>Next task consist of creating your new payment module implementation logic. Payment modules can be packaged in Shopizer or as a standalone maven dependency. For creating a dependency project it requires maven skills and ability to host your module on Nexus sonatype or other Maven central repository. Creating a module packaged in Shopizer is the easiest option, which basically requires the creation of your implementation class in com.salesmanager.core.business.modules.integration.payment.impl</p><p>Class name must be your module code in camel case, so for instance if you created <strong>mytest</strong> as module code then your implementation should be <strong>MyTestPayment.class</strong></p><p>There are a few PaymentModule samples available here <a href="https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/tree/master/sm-core/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/business/modules/integration/payment/impl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/tree/master/sm-core/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/business/modules/integration/payment/impl</a></p><p>Most of Payment Gateway have unit tests and examples in java that you can plug in each of the ne generated module code.</p><p>Merchant credentials used for doing authentication in payment gateway are encrypted using sha encryption when they are saved in the database. From the database point of view, payment information is grouped in a single encrupted database row.</p><p>Using the administration api and administration tool are the only way to modify payment integration data.</p><p>Payment integration data can be retrieved this way</p><p>IntegrationConfiguration configuration = paymentService.getPaymentConfiguration(&quot;mytest&quot;, merchantStore);</p><p>Map &lt; String,String &gt; keys = configuration.getIntegrationKeys();</p><p>Payment integration data can be saved this way</p><p>IntegrationConfiguration configuration = new IntegrationConfiguration();</p><p>configuration.setCode(&quot;mytest&quot;);<br> configuration.setActive(true);</p><p>configuration.setEnvironment(IntegrationConfiguration. TEST_ENVIRONMENT);</p><p>configuration.setDefaultSelected(true);</p><p>configuration.getIntegrationKeys().add(&quot;asecretkey&quot;,&quot;value&quot;);<br> ...</p><p>paymentService.savePaymentModuleConfiguration(configuration, merchantStore);</p><ul><li>Unit test your new payment module</li></ul><p>Unit testing a payment module is the best way to test all possibilities and variations of real time scenario. There are existing tests in sm-core component that can be used as starting point for unit testing your module.</p><ul><li>Create an admin ui for being able to use your module</li></ul><p>Last milestone consist in creating an administration page for storing module credentials and keys. Shopizer has an existing administration framework for easing the creation of a dedicated page for your new payment module.</p><p>Existing payment administration pages can be used as starting point for creating your page. Your new page has to be created in sm-shop/src/main/webapp/pages/admin/payment</p><p>Administration page must be named as the payment module code &quot;mytest.jsp&quot;. Payment module administration page must contain keys and credentials sections like this:</p><p>1- Labels must be defined in resource bundles</p><p>2- Keys and credentials are defined this way</p><p>3- Section for handling empty key / credential submission</p><p>Nothing more is required from UI perspective.</p><p>Final step is to make sure the module UI is displayed in Payment method list administration page. Make sure keys and credentials can be saved and retrieved and finally perform complete integration test with your new payment module.</p>',63),r=[i];function s(u,p,m,l,d,c){return o(),t("div",null,r)}var y=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,y as default};
