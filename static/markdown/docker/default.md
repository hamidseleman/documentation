### Run Shopizer and dependency with Docker Compose

**Requirements**: Have Docker Compose installed. See [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ ) installation instructions.

Docker Compose simplifies configurtion and container dependency with the configuration of a yaml file that lets connect Shopizer to outer dependencies such as Elastic Search and MySQL.

```sh

Copy the file above in a text file and name it docker-compose.yml
The content of this file consist of minimal configurations for running shopizer configured with Elastic Search and MySQL. 

To run dependency project (Shopizer + Elastic Search + MySQL), cd to the directoy where you have created **docker-compose.yml** file and type this command:

```sh
$ docker-compose up
```

This will start an empty store that you can start building with MySQL and Elastic Search running. Take note that MySQL is running on port 3307 and ElasticSearch on port 9200. In case of conflicts those ports can be changed.

You can connect to MySQL using your SQL client. Password as specified in docker-compose.yml is **my-password**

```sh
mysql -u shopizer_db_user -p -h 127.0.0.1:3307
```
