## Requirements

Shopizer is built using Java and requires **Java Development Kit version 8** installed. First step is to check if java is installed. For this open a shell or command line.

```sh
$ java -version
```

In order to build Shopizer you should have a complete Java SDK (software development kit) available on your machine. In order to verify if java sdk is installed on your computer use this command:

```sh
$ javac
```

You should see which version of java is installed and if a SDK is available. Version 8 of java SDK is required and can be downloaded from here [Java version 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
